# ProjectRedPanda
### A fun mining game made with React to practice web development skills
#### Features
###### 4 views
Project Red Panda currently has 4 placeholder views:
1. Map
2. Fleet
3. Factory
4. Shipyard
The only working view is currently the Map view, where the user can obtain resources

###### Resource Collection
A player can collect resources in the Map view by clicking the "Start Mining" button
These resources can be placed into the users inventory and are intended to have a sell button after further development
Resources are displayed by the users current "gather level", as the gather level increases the player unlocks new resources


###### Resources
Resources are their own object, each has 3 stats:
1. Difficulty
Difficulty is the required "gather level" a player must have to mine that resource. If gather level is too low the resource will not display
2. Exp
Exp is obtainable by mining resources. Each resource mined adds that much EXP to the player which increment gather level
3. Value
Value is the sell cost of a resource. It can be used to obtain cash which will allow the player to buy upgrades, increasing the mining ability of the player



This project is a work in progress and was made among a group of 3 friends
